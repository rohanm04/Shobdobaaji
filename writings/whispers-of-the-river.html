        <h1>Whispers of the River</h1>
        <p class="lead just">
            I picked up a smooth, flat stone from the riverbank and flicked it across the water.
            It skipped elegantly three times, bouncing through the pale white glisten of the sun's
            reflection before drowning in the river with a final splash. Turning around, I caught
            sight of Kannu, who had the same idea. His eyes scanned the bank for the flattest of
            stones. As our gazes met, he grinned and yelled out, "The one with the most skips wins!"
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            A friendly competition never hurt anyone, I thought. I picked up stone after stone,
            chucking them across the river. Some sank instantly without a single skip, while others
            danced over the surface, making it as far as five skips. But Kannu, he was something else.
            We both had spent all our childhood here, in the serenity and lonesome of Mirshila. The
            river, just a short walk from the town, had been his childhood getaway. Back then, after
            school, he would come here and spend his entire afternoon skipping stones over the river.
            Even though school had ended about ten years ago, his skill remained untouched by time.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            Like a ballerino in perfect rhythm, his movements were graceful and well choreographed. In
            a single, swift motion, he swung his arm around and with a final flick of his wrist, sent
            the stone flying over the river, skipping one, two, three... Seven, eight... Too many times to
            count. It seemed to glide over the water effortlessly, almost defying gravity itself. And then,
            in its final act, it slowed, dipped, and finally disappeared into the depth of the river.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            A short while later, I wandered over to a large rock and climbed onto it, sinking into its cool
            surface. Tired from skipping stones throughout the afternoon, I took a moment to catch my breath
            and rested myself up on the rock. Across the river, the deodar trees swayed gently, their dark
            silhouettes dancing against a fiery orange canvas. The sun, now kissing the horizon, burned
            through the gaps in the foliage, casting golden streaks across the water.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            The trees gradually merged and transitioned into a dense patch of shrubs before giving way to
            the rocky riverbank. And by the water's edge stood Kannu, still searching for the perfect stones
            and flicking them across the river.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            A few minutes later, Kannu joined me, panting and sweating, and gesturing me for a bottle of water.
            I got up and walked over to his canvas travel bag and pulled out a single bottle. As I did, a small
            notebook fell from the side. I picked it up, and just as I was about to slip it back in, I noticed
            a loose page carelessly tucked between its covers. My fingers were mysteriously drawn to it. Before
            I could take a closer look, Kannu called out, "Hey, what's taking so long?"
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            I rushed back and handed him the bottle. He snatched it out of my hand and took a long sip, leaving
            only half of the bottle filled. Letting out a few long breaths, he slowly leaned back until he was
            laying over the rock. I climbed back up and sat beside him. For a while, we rested in silence. Then,
            with a sudden burst of energy, Kannu sat up and sprang down onto the ground. He turned to look at me,
            smiled, and said, "It's already evening; you want me to go get some food?"
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            I smiled back at his enthusiasm and nodded in agreement. He stretched his arms out, and remarked, "It
            will be hell to cook with these sore arms so you gotta wait for sometime, okay? And don't run off
            anywhere!" I chuckled and gave him a thumbs-up. He stretched for a few more moments and then took off
            towards town. His figure faded into the disappearing daylight.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            With Kannu gone, I was left alone by the riverbank. Mirshila was a quiet, small town nestled in the
            hills of the Himalayas. It never drew many tourists, and the locals rarely visited the river.
            Occasionally, one could spot a few kids skipping stones or splashing in the water, but even they would
            leave by the evening.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            The town was serene, beautiful in its own way; but we had long since outgrown its charm. When we were
            children, we found adventure in its hills, where the untamed thrill of its trails and forests stood
            in contrast to the town's practiced peace. But as we grew older, life at Mirshila became predictable.
            After a few years, we both came to the same realization; there was nothing left for us here. Life in
            Mirshila had its own harmonic rhythm. Most people spent their days working on their farms, and by night,
            the town drifted into an unnerving silence. Others left for bigger, busier towns to start travel agencies
            or run small shops. Kannu left too. After finishing school, he went to Punjab for college. I stayed
            behind.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            As my mind travelled through the memories of our childhood and Mirshila, the thought of the notebook
            crept back in. I tried to push it away, telling myself that it was wrong to go through someone's personal
            journal. But the more I resisted, the stronger the temptation grew. Curiosity got the better of me and I
            finally gave in.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            I crawled off the rock and walked over to the travel bag. Reaching in, I pulled out the notebook. It
            looked unremarkable; it had a navy blue cover, made of worn faux leather. The spine was creased and bent.
            The loose page peeked out like a piece of candy to a child. I slowly pinched its corner and slid it free.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            Gibberish.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            My reward for such an offensive act was a mess of incoherent scribbles. Most of the words were written in
            a language unknown to me. The others were fragmented notes in English... "Place by the river", "2:41 pm",
            and other cryptic phrases.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            I flipped through the notebook to a random page to tuck the loose sheet back in. That's when a particular
            sentence caught my eye: "Shamanic rituals and practices".
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            I went over the notebook. Page after page, it read like the ramblings of a madman. Rituals for contacting
            spirits, instructions on how to access someone else's memories. Some words were underlined multiple times
            while others were encircled. A chill crept up my spine. And then, the final piece of the puzzle, tucked away
            at the bottom of a page, almost too small to notice: "The river carries the dead."
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            I felt sick. My mind went into a frenzy. Is this why Kannu returned to Mirshila? Was reuniting with me,
            seeing his family... Was all of that just a lie?
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            We grew up listening to stories about the river. One in particular had always fascinated Kannu. The elders
            used to say that the river trapped the memories of those who had drowned in it. If you listened closely, it
            would whisper their names. There were countless other legends, none of which I ever believed. But Kannu was
            different. He always seemed to be intrigued by the unknown. It would explain why he spent all those afternoons
            by the river after school. But shamanic rituals? That was something else entirely.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            I hurriedly stuffed the notebook back into the bag and stepped toward the river. The last remnants of daylight
            had faded, swallowed by the darkness of the evening. At the horizon, the moon peeked through the drifting clouds,
            a lone torchlight in the fog. I inched closer to the river until the cool water lapped over my toes. My reflection
            stared back at me, the moon hovering just behind me like a silent watcher. I closed my eyes. The world around me
            dissolved into darkness, and every sound amplified, louder, clearer.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            Crickets chirped in the distance. Mosquitoes buzzed past my ears. But above it all, the river hummed with its waves
            crashing and splashing that drowned everything else. My ears searched for whispers. For names. A part of me wanted
            to believe the stories. I focused harder, listening, searching. The splashing intensified. And then, amidst the
            churning water, a voice.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            "Parekh."
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            My eyes snapped open. A shiver ran down my spine, every hair on my body standing on end. I was frozen, locked in
            place by a sudden, unbearable cold. Then, again, louder, closer.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            "Parekh!"
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            The voice was familiar. Excited, even. My breath caught as I turned, only to find Kannu waving at me from a distance.
            "Parekh!", He called out to me, "What are you doing there? Come back here, I got the food!"
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            My muscles slowly relaxed and my mind came to an ease. I made my way back to Kannu. He had returned with a jute bag,
            filled to the brim with containers. As he pulled them out one by one, he announced each dish with a story, his voice
            filled with nostalgia. "Here's the mutton, cooked Mirshila style! Remember when we stole a goat from Dannik uncle?
            That was a day, haha! Oh, and here's the vegetable curry, all homegrown. Hated it as a kid, but weirdly, I have been
            craving it ever since I got here..."
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            He went on, lost in his memories. His laughter followed every story, even when it didn't belong. But I wasn't listening.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            My mind was elsewhere, fixated upon the notebook, on the cryptic scribblings, on the rituals. The questions burned
            inside me. What was he really doing here? Why was he writing about spirits? I wanted to ask. To confront him. But I was
            afraid. Afraid of the interaction. Afraid of the river. Afraid of Kannu himself.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            He laid out a mat and set down two plates. I had lost my appetite, but I humored him. He scooped a bowl of rice for
            himself, then one for me. One after the other, he carefully placed a portion of each dish. Finally, with a satisfied
            voice, he declared, "Time to feast!"
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            He grabbed a handful of rice, mixed it with the curries, and stuffed his mouth like he hadn't eaten in days. The steam
            rising from the food, and Kannu's complete ignorance of it, signified his hunger. "The hills make you hungrier", Kannu
            used to say as a kid. And even now, he stayed true to that. But I wasn't eating. He seemed to notice that. Between
            mouthfuls, he glanced at me. "You know, if you don't eat now, you're gonna faint. That was a lot of exercise, skipping
            stones and all."
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            I gave a slight nod, staring at my plate, but made no move to eat. Kannu sighed dramatically. "Well, if you're not
            gonna eat any," Kannu declared and dragged my plate over to his side. "That just means more for me!"
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            He devoured my share as well, every bite filled with content. For a brief moment, it felt normal. It felt like the days
            of the past, when we were young and carefree. After he was done, he walked down to the river to wash his hands. The
            sound of the water splashing was the only sound that remained now. The clouds had long drifted away and the moon was the
            lone beam of light in the dawning night. In the distance, the trees retired from their performance. Ever so often, they
            would sweep their branches, acknowledging the continued presence of a gentler wind.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            When Kannu returned, he packed up the trash in the jute bag, and then lay down beside me, gazing up at the moon. "Finally
            a full moon tonight," he murmured, "gotta wait another thirty days for that."
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            There was a slight sadness in his voice. He turned his head toward me. "I do miss the time we spent, you know? I wish you
            could still talk." His eyes drifted downward, settling on the river. His voice was quiet when he spoke again, "Do you
            still remember that day?"
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            My mind was blank. I had no idea what he meant. But he was not expecting an answer. "It was so beautiful. It was a day
            just like this," he continued. "We skipped stones; and for once, you actually beat me, remember? You danced like a fool.
            And I was furious! I have always been a sore loser."
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            The air stirred, the wind grew sharper.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            A shaky laugh escaped Kannu but his voice wavered. He struggled to speak, "And the food... God, some of the best food we
            ever had! You were so stuffed you passed out for a whole hour!" He paused, swallowing hard. "Don't you remember anything?"
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            I just stared at him. He looked up at me, his eyes glistening under the moonlight. A single drop of tear trickled down his
            cheek, carving a meandering path like the river below. "I am sorry, Parekh," his voice was barely above a whisper. "I
            should have stopped you from going into the river... I didn't know you couldn't swim..."
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            A silence befell upon us. Kannu sobbed, covering his face. He kept repeating the same words, over and over. "I didn't know
            you couldn't swim."
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            The air around us felt heavier, pressing down on me with an unbearable weight. I felt detached, as though I were no longer
            a part of the world around me. Mirshila, my hometown, now felt like an entirely different realm. The monstrous black
            silhouettes of the trees danced, their movements mocking my existence. The river, ignoring my sorrow, continued its song.
            Its water shimmered under the moon, inviting me to it.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            I slowly rose to my feet and with measured, deliberate steps, approached the river. This time, the water reached my knees. I
            stood there, staring at my reflection once more. The moon, perfectly aligned behind my head, formed a ghostly halo. I closed
            my eyes again. The world faded into nothingness once more, leaving only its sounds
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            The crickets had gone silent. The mosquitoes had vanished. Only the river remained; crashing, thrashing, restless. Cold waves
            splashed against my legs, the wind weaving through them, carrying a low, eerie howl. And then, amidst the chaos, amidst the
            ceaseless roar, a voice. Calm, peaceful, it rose from below and oscillated through my ears. A heavenly whisper floating
            through the night like a feather in the wind.
        </p>
        <p class="lead just">
            "Parekh."
