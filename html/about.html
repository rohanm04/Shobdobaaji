            I'm Rohan Mallik, a writer who finds artistry in the overlooked moments of everyday life. I write in
            both Bengali and English, and my work spans short stories and poems. Though primarily rooted in fiction,
            much of my writing draws inspiration from real-life experiences and the human element of it. Every story,
            every character, is essentially a part of me; an extension of who I am.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            This website is home to all my writings: poems, short stories, collections, verses, and everything in-between.
            I write with the hope of reaching readers who discover a piece of themselves in my words.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Outside of writing, you'll most likely catch me reading, watching films, or scribbling random ideas into a
            notebook. I have a habit of talking people's ears off, yet it's often the silences in-between that inspire me
            most.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Thank you for visiting and for taking the time to read my work. I hope you find something here that resonates
            with you.
